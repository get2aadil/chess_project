                <p class="card-text text-justify">
                    Chess is one of the oldest and most widely played games around the
                    world. Itâ€™s a strategy game for two players, where both skill and
                    patience are key. The game as we know it today has evolved over many
                    centuries, but its roots go back to Northern India around the 6th
                    century, where it was called chaturanga. From there, it spread to
                    Persia and gained popularity. Eventually, it made its way to the Arab
                    world and later Europe during the Middle Ages.

                    By the 15th century, chess had taken on the form we recognize now,
                    with the introduction of the powerful Queen piece. Over time, chess
                    became a global phenomenon, enjoyed by millions of people from
                    different cultures and backgrounds. Beyond being a fun game, chess is
                    also known for helping players develop critical thinking and
                    problem-solving skills, which is why it remains so popular today.
