            <p>
                The primary objective in chess is to checkmate your opponent's King. This means putting the King under
                threat of capture in such a way that there is no legal move the opponent can make to escape the threat.

            <h4>Chessboard Setup</h4>
            <p>
                Chess is played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard. The board is arranged so that each player has a
                white (or light-colored) square at the bottom-right corner. Each player starts with 16 pieces:

            <h4>Special Moves</h4>
            <p>
                Besides standard moves, there are a few special moves in chess:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Castling:</strong> A move that involves the King and one of the Rooks. It allows the King to
                    move two squares towards a Rook on the player's first rank, then the Rook moves to the square the
                    King crossed. Castling can only occur if neither the King nor the Rook has moved, there are no
                    pieces between them, and the King is not in check or moving through/checking.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can occur immediately after an opponent's
                    pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position, passing through the square where it could
                    have been captured by your pawn. Your pawn can capture the opponent's pawn "in passing" as if it had
                    moved only one square forward.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Pawn Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the farthest row from its starting position, it
                    must be promoted to another piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight). Most players choose to promote
                    to a Queen.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <!-- Check and Checkmate -->
    <div class="row mb-4">
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h4>Check and Checkmate</h4>
            <p>
                - <strong>Check:</strong> When a King is under threat of capture, it is in "check." The player must make
                a move to remove the threat by moving the King, blocking the attack, or capturing the attacking piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                - <strong>Checkmate:</strong> When a King is in check and there are no legal moves to escape the threat,
                it is "checkmate," and the game is over. The player whose King is checkmated loses the game.

            <h4>Draws</h4>
            <p>
                A game can end in a draw under certain conditions:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Stalemate:</strong> Occurs when the player whose turn it is has no legal moves and their
                    King is not in check.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Threefold Repetition:</strong> If the same position occurs three times with the same player
                    to move, either player can claim a draw.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Fifty-Move Rule:</strong> If fifty consecutive moves are made by both players without any
                    pawn movement or capture, either player can claim a draw.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Insufficient Material:</strong> If neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate
                    (e.g., King vs. King, King and Bishop vs. King), the game is a draw.
